# Real_estate project
At my disposal were provided the data of the Yandex Real Estate service — an archive of ads for several years about the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements.
I preprocessed the data and studied them to find interesting features and dependencies that exist in the real estate market.
The database contains two types of data about each apartment: user-added and cartographic. For example, the first type includes the area of the apartment, its floor and the number of balconies, the second — the distance to the city center, the airport and the nearest park.
