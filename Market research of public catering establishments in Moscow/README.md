## Recommendations for opening a new establishment

- the optimal location for a coffee shop will be the central administrative district. The competition in it is quite high, but also high attendance and a large concentration of people;
- a round-the-clock coffee shop would be a good choice, since there are quite a few round-the-clock coffee shops, while they have a high rating
- it is worth focusing on the price of a cup of cappuccino about 170 rubles.
