Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) were presented from open sources. I have identified patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
Data up to 2016 are presented.
The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), an association that determines the age rating of computer games. ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it a suitable age category, for example, "For adults", "For younger children" or "For teenagers".
