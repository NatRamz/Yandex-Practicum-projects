It is necessary to study the data of the Procrastinate Pro+ entertainment application. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the past few months. The task is to understand the reasons and help the company to raise income.
There is data on users attracted from May 1 to October 27, 2019:

- server log with data on their visits,
- unloading of their purchases for this period,
- advertising expenses.

It is necessary to study:

- where users come from and what devices they use,
- how much does it cost to attract users from various advertising channels;
- how much money does each client bring,
- when the cost of attracting a client pays off,
- what factors prevent attracting customers.

Data description

Three datasets have been provided. The visits_info_short.csv file stores the server log with information about site visits, orders_info_short.csv — information about orders, and costs_info_short.csv — information about advertising expenses.

Research Steps:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Adding functions for further calculations
3. Research data analysis: creating user profiles, studying data about them. 
4. Marketing analysis: calculation of the total amount of marketing expenses and distribution of expenses by advertising sources.
5. Evaluation of the payback of advertising, calculation of LTV, ROI, CR, CTR, Retention in various distributions. 

Conclusions:

During the research analysis of the data, it was found that:

The largest number of new users to the app came from the USA, and in the same region the highest proportion of paying users.
Most users use iPhone, most paying users use iPhone and Mac. Curiously, the number of Mac users is the least - 30,042, almost half as many as iPhone users, but the share of paying users is even slightly higher.
Most of the users were attracted organically, but they have the lowest conversion rate. The most paying users came through the FaceBoom channel.
During the marketing analysis of the data, it was found that a total of 105,497 were spent on marketing, investments are distributed rather unevenly, the TipTop platform receives the largest financial injections. FaceBoom is in second place.

The evaluation of the payback of advertising revealed a potential problem with users from the United States and users of Apple products. Users from the USA require the most attention: with sufficiently high conversions, they have very low retention rates. Moreover, the retention of paying users decreases in comparison with the rest more than non-paying ones. Campaigns on the Faceboom and AdNonSense platforms also require attention - with a high conversion rate, they show a rather weak retention.
