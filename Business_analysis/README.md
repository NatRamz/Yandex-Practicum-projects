It is necessary to study the data of the Procrastinate Pro+ entertainment application. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the past few months. The task is to understand the reasons and help the company to raise income.
There is data on users attracted from May 1 to October 27, 2019:

- server log with data on their visits,
- unloading of their purchases for this period,
- advertising expenses.

It is necessary to study:

- where users come from and what devices they use,
- how much does it cost to attract users from various advertising channels;
- how much money does each client bring,
- when the cost of attracting a client pays off,
- what factors prevent attracting customers.

Data description

Three datasets have been provided. The visits_info_short.csv file stores the server log with information about site visits, orders_info_short.csv — information about orders, and costs_info_short.csv — information about advertising expenses.
