# A/B-test and prioritization 

The data of a large online store is provided. It is necessary to prioritize the hypotheses provided by the marketing department to increase revenue, run an A/B test and analyze its results.

Data description:

- hypothesis.csv is a dataset that stores data about hypotheses. Contains a brief description of the hypothesis, the reach of users on a 10-point scale, the impact on users on a 10-point scale, and the cost of resources to test the hypothesis on a 10-point scale.
- orders.csv - stores data about orders of online store users. Contains the order ID, the user who made the order, the order date, the revenue from the order, and the test group that the order fell into.
